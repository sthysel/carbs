Configuration files managed by Tuckr. Run `tuckr add *` to symlink all dotfiles into ~/.config/

Structure:
- Configs/: Dotfile groups (each subdirectory is a package like zsh, nvim, hyprland, etc.)
- Hooks/: Setup and cleanup scripts
- Secrets/: Encrypted sensitive files

Run `just dotfiles` to deploy all dotfiles.

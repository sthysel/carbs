* Asciinema Package

Tuckr package for asciinema terminal session recording and gif generation.

** What's Included

- *asciinema* (v3.0.1+): Terminal session recorder
- *asciinema-agg* (v1.7.0+): Converts recordings to animated GIFs
- Configuration file with sensible defaults

** Installation

#+begin_src sh
# Link the asciinema configs (triggers pre-hook to install packages)
tuckr add asciinema

# Or link all configs
tuckr set *
#+end_src

The pre-hook script will automatically install:
- =asciinema= - Terminal session recorder
- =asciinema-agg= - GIF generator (installed from AUR)

** Usage

*** Recording Sessions

#+begin_src sh
# Record a session
asciinema rec demo.cast

# Record with a title
asciinema rec -t "My Demo" demo.cast

# Record and append to existing file
asciinema rec -a demo.cast
#+end_src

*** Playback

#+begin_src sh
# Play back a recording
asciinema play demo.cast

# Play at 2x speed
asciinema play -s 2 demo.cast
#+end_src

*** Generate GIFs

#+begin_src sh
# Convert recording to GIF (note: command is 'agg', not 'asciinema-agg')
agg demo.cast demo.gif

# Customize GIF settings
agg --speed 2 --font-size 14 demo.cast demo.gif
#+end_src

*** Upload and Share

#+begin_src sh
# Upload to asciinema.org
asciinema upload demo.cast

# Record and upload in one step
asciinema rec
# (Press Ctrl-D when done, will prompt to upload)
#+end_src

** Configuration

The configuration file is located at =~/.config/asciinema/config= and includes:

*** Recording Settings
- *Command*: =/usr/bin/zsh= (default shell)
- *Idle time limit*: 2 seconds (cuts long pauses in recordings)
- *Stdin recording*: Enabled

*** Playback Settings
- *Speed*: 1x (normal)
- *Idle time limit*: 2 seconds (speeds up pauses during playback)

These defaults make recordings more professional by automatically trimming long idle periods.
